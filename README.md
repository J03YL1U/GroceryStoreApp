# Grocery Store Application
We are a team of 6 McGill Engineering students creating a grocery store website and application designed for a small town. The grocery store system would allow customers to browse through items in the store and order online delivery or pickup. The system is also designed to help facilitate the management of the the stores inventory, opening hours, and staff.
